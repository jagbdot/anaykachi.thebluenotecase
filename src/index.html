						<p class='content-description'><b>1. What is the documentary about?</b><br>— The film is about the Salt workers of the Peruvian Andes, a community in Maras where indigenous people have been living and harvesting salt by hand for over 600 years. We documented their daily life right on 2019. Is a 13 minute Short documentary with historic images captured on 35mm and super 8mm film, sound recordings and illustrations.<br><br> <b>2. What is the need for a website about the film?</b><br>— The main idea is to promote the film and having it online to apply for many festivals around the world. We have a debt with those people because we learned about some injustices related with the <i>Pruvian goverment</i> and the ownership of the land they work with. We want to shine a light on that issue as well as telling a great story. There're many forms of documentation related with the documentary, we have a few live sound recordings, drawings and good imagery, so we also pretend to show all that.<br><br><b>3. Who will be the main target/niche to show the film to?</b><br> — The main target are the festivals we'll apply to show the work that has been done. Also, this is a strong piece from our portfolio to show up and generate more work related in the future. So anybody interested in this industry is welcome for us to talk and connect.<br><br><b>4. Do you want to show the film right on the website?</b><br> — Actually we just want to show the trailer and the documentation, the actual documentary will be viewed by people organizing the film festivals. We want to have it all set and atractive to make it to the top<br><b>5. How do you imagine the website? Do you have any expectatives in terms of the design?</b><br> — We would like something interactive, modern but keeping the highlight on the work. Big images. We also want it to be able to play the sounds we recorded and the film trailer in a smooth way. To make it a story itself with written word and images, videos, etc.<br><br><b>6. How was done the doumentation; the drawings, the videos?</b><br> — We got great equipment. The drawings were done by Victoria Leader, an illustrator from Canada, she happened to be with us on the journey. The images were done in different sets; digital and analogic. We also had a super 8mm to record in a different light some scenes from Maras. <br><br><b>7. What would be the best scenario as a result of promoting the film online?</b><br> — The best scenario for us would be to get into as many festivals we could and make the film public in many countries. The project is very close to our heart side and we just want to share that feeling around. The work is already nominated in three festivals but they asked for links related to it, so we realized the importance of having the complete documentation online in order to make it more accesible and proffesional.<br><br><b>8. What are the main subjects you want to highlight for the website?</b><br> — We want to show the story of the community. Explain who we are and why we do it. Show the team, the festivals already involved. Finally, the trailer and the documentation related.</p>
